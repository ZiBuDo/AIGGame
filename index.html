					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
					Welcome to AIG Game, a game that can be deployed on a social network to help teach risk mitigation. This game is geared to make implicit risks explicit through gameplay and socializing through the game. Implicit risks are risks that people bear based on their daily activities. These risks are not inherently expressive, and thus many people will go about their day without knowing they are assuming these implicit risks. Examples of these implicit risks are when people use their technological devices. They are open to a plethora of security risks of having their information stolen or worse. The goal of this game to effectively make these risks implicit so that users can make more informed decisions and be smarter about the risks that they take on. <br><br>
In addition to the implicit risks, the game also takes a social approach. The goal of this game would be to deploy it alongside a social network such as Facebook which contains many games. This would allow players to connect with friends. The game allows users to see each other’s risk profile. A risk profile is a comprehensive profile based on risk management techniques. The techniques are avoidance, acceptance, transferring risk, and reducing risk. These are further broken up into sub-categories and assigned values based on gameplay. Users can answer questions to affect their risk profile in game to determine inherent risks in each activity. Furthermore, there are mini games which track specific actions the user takes when faced with a scenario. The example mini game that is deployed is a street crossing mini game where the player must cross the street while collecting stars and diamonds. The game tracks movement and score while increasing difficulty. Afterwards, the players risk profile is changed to reflect their risks they assumed and took during the game. <br><br>
Since players can see other player risk profiles, it gives the game a nature akin to a group. Players will inquire how their friends managed to make their risk profiles look a certain way and discuss behavior in the mini games. The most important aspect of this game, is that it is created to maintain the feel of a game. It is not rewarding or punishing for certain playstyles, but rather a grounds for exploration to find risks players may have not known about. The game allows players to make decisions and see how it affects their simulation. The player’s choices are not set in stone, and thus the player is able to develop multiple paths that they could take. Decisions are based on pollution, activity, eating habits, safety, traffic, and more. When making a decision, an answer can affect almost all the risk profile categories which will affect the world the user creates. <br><br>
The creation of the world is populated by the user’s friends that can be found in the social tab. These friends are added in the world, and are used in the simulation. The simulation shows the current state of the world right now and projects future happiness, pollution, healthiness, and safety over the next 100 years if these habits persist. The simulation accounts for all players in the group while showing the riskiest player and the safest player which do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. The simulation aspect of the game allows players to see the culmination of risk habits and the effects on society in a simple format. This simply format does not overload the user with information despite the fact the risk management techniques are used in complex equations to determine the future projections and current state. <br><br>
The explicit statements of risks previously known to be implicit by the user is very important because the user knows what risks they now bear; however, the nature of the game will show that being risk averse is usually rewarding; however, it does factor in happiness and economic factors that usually thrive on risk, and thus it teaches the user to balance the two. This is important because it shows the user that risk aversion is a necessity; however, a person shouldn’t go their entire life by simply avoiding all dangers because they would bear some risk in those situations. Rather it is teaching the user to create a maximizing function that finds the most happiness, and the most risk aversion together through the mini games, decisions, and simulations.<br><br>
The technology is straight forward, but the game framework presented is unique in what it does, and thus I believe it will be accepted because there are many studies that show the effectiveness of this method whether it be geared towards school aged children as programs in public and private schools, or simply as a desktop, mobile, or wearable on a watch type of game that people socialize with. Please see the research tab for specific sources. Games like these are usually distributed alongside a social network, and thus the distribution platform is present with a large user base. This game presents the opportunity for AIG to delve deeper into the game framework presented and data mine to create more accurate models or models to predict how people will react to new risks based on their risk profiles. This is important because risks are always popping up with the emergence of new technologies. Furthermore, the game would be accepted because it can be made addicting through social pressures that have been implemented in such games as Candy Crush which cause people to compare their progress; however, for this AIG Game it is more about risk profile and high scores in mini games to boast prowess in the risk assessment realm.

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>
						The intended target audiences with this game are two pronged. The first audience is children in school around the ages of eight to sixteen. This game can be implemented socially in the school system to allow children to develop risk management skills implicitly through the game; however, since the game states the risk management techniques in the risk profiles, then students will be able to understand how their decisions affect their risk management styles. The adoption of the games in schools will be challenged by the effectiveness of the game as a teaching mechanism and a learning tool. I believe that the RPG style of the game allows students to express themselves to a large degree and opens the game up to a larger environment which the children can run more specific or advanced simulations.<br><br>
<a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED026857">Research that indicates simulation games are effective in teaching children and almost more so in pure areas or learning which is directly correlated in this instance as risk management is highly geared towards pure risks have been dated back to 1968.</a> This study specifically focuses on the exploration aspect as previously mentioned about the game framework. It allows children to develop skills which in turn will create a safer and healthier world because they will understand the relationship between the implicit risks and their happiness.<br><br>
<a href="http://sag.sagepub.com/content/23/3/261.short"> This study is more suited towards explaining the fact that a simulation game such as the one presented it aptly able to more efficiently teach children about the science of risk assessment in a mathematical context. </a> Logic games were among the games that were most favored by users who utilized games as an instructional method, and thus the AIG Game is then aptly suited to follow in those footsteps because risks can be logically deduced to be more the risk or not based on the previously mentioned maximizing function of happiness and risk aversion.<br><br>

The second audience is more fickle because this is the mainstream consumer who would play this game primarily through Facebook as a distributor. There are enticing aspects for AIG to pair up with Facebook as both companies can benefit from more user data especially within the insurance and risk fields. However, besides those prospects, the adoption of the game within the community are based on a twofold strategy. First, is that the game implements the social aspect without creating a reliance on other people’s assistance to play. This removes any annoying game invites that Facebook users must ignore throughout the day. Secondly, the minimal social connection previously stated allows users to focus more on the impact their friend has on their simulation rather than as a needed companion, and thus this will create a social conversation between the friends which will cause the game to grow in popularity and be shared across friend groups. The social conversation which arises from the game is based on the risk profiles developed through algorithms that can be taken from Facebook, or from the game itself. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/28/new-stats-shed-light-on-mobile-gaming-audiences-and-adoption/">Reference</a>.
